                <h4>To My Love:</h4>
                <p>Hello Love, I created this website as my gift for you
                    since <br>we didn't get to have a date hehe. I hope that this website<br>
                    will atleast make you feel that how much I love you. 
                    <br>This is to show you
                    the love I have for you and how much I really <br>think about you. There are a lot of times that I think
                    <br>and feel that I am not giving you the love that you<br> deserve and that you might think
                    that I'm not good enough <br>for you. That is why there are several photos of us here that <br>I want to show you
                    to make you remember that I am always with you.<br>
                    Although we have vast amount of pictures.<br>
                    These are the photos I want you to see to make you remember that <br>
                    we are together every month and that we enjoy ourselves when we are<br>
                    together.
